## 0. ACCOUNT CREATION & WALLET SETUP

### Account Creation

| Step | PassKit Process | Your App Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1. Sign up | Company name, website, username (permanent), work email | YOU HAVE | Basic user registration exists |
| 2. Business email validation | Non-business emails (Gmail, Yahoo) require manual approval | MISSING | No email domain validation |
| 3. Email verification | Verify email before account is active | YOU HAVE | Standard email verification |
| 4. Data region selection | EU (`pub1.pskt.io`) or US (`pub2.pskt.io`) -- irreversible | MISSING | No data region selection |
| 5. Company industry selection | Dropdown for tailored support | MISSING | No industry categorization |
| 6. Account tier progression | Email Verified → Payment Added → Production → Live | MISSING | You have subscription plans but no progressive unlock system |

### Account Status Tiers (PassKit Model)

| Status | Passes/Project | Total Passes | Pass Auto-Delete | CSV Import |
|--------|---------------|-------------|------------------|------------|
| Email Not Verified | 0 | 0 | N/A | No |
| Email Verified | 5 | 50 | After 48 hrs | No |
| Verified + Payment/Certificate | 100 | 1,000 | After 48 hrs | No |
| Production Account | 1,000 | 10,000 | After 48 hrs | Yes |
| **Live Project** | **Unlimited** | **Unlimited** | **Never** | **Yes** |

**Your App:** You have flat tier-based pass limits (Free: 25, Starter: 100, Growth: 500, etc.) but no progressive unlock or draft/live distinction. **Status: PARTIAL**

### Apple Wallet Setup

| Step | PassKit Process | Your App Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Prerequisites** | | | |
| Apple Developer Program ($99/yr) | Required -- only way Apple allows pass certificates | MISSING (no guidance) | No onboarding flow guides users through this |
| **Phase 1: Generate CSR** | | | |
| 1. Navigate to Certificates page | UI at `Account > Certificates` | MISSING | No certificate management UI |
| 2. Click "Add Certificate" | Button to start CSR generation | MISSING | Certificates managed via config files only |
| 3. Download CSR file | `cert.certSigningRequest` file generated by platform | MISSING | CSR is not generated by your app |
| **Phase 2: Register Pass Type ID** | | | |
| 4. Log into Apple Developer Portal | External step -- user does this manually | N/A | Same for both systems |
| 5. Create Pass Type ID | e.g., `pass.com.yourcompany.loyalty` | N/A | External Apple step |
| 6. Generate certificate using CSR | Upload CSR to Apple, download `.cer` | N/A | External Apple step |
| **Phase 3: Upload Certificate** | | | |
| 7. Upload `.cer` to platform | Drag-and-drop upload in UI | MISSING | You require manual server config (`.p12` file + password in `passkit.php`) |
| 8. View certificate details & expiry | UI shows cert status, Valid To date | MISSING | No visibility into cert status from UI |
| **Phase 4: Certificate Renewal** | | | |
| 9. Renewal flow (every 12 months) | Renew button, re-download CSR, re-upload new cert | MISSING | No renewal workflow or expiry notifications |
| 10. Expiry calendar reminders | Platform warns 30 days before expiry | MISSING | No expiry tracking or alerting |

**Summary:** Your app requires Apple credentials to be manually configured in `config/passkit.php` (certificate path, password, WWDR cert, team ID, pass type ID, org name). PassKit provides a full self-service UI for CSR generation, certificate upload, renewal, and expiry tracking. **Status: PARTIAL**

### Google Wallet Setup

| Step | PassKit Process | Your App Status | Notes |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------|
| **PassKit approach** | Zero setup needed -- PassKit handles everything automatically | N/A | PassKit manages all Google certs on behalf of users |
| **Your app approach** | | | |
| 1. Create Google Cloud project | User must create GCP project manually | MISSING (no guidance) | No onboarding guide |
| 2. Enable Google Wallet API | User enables API in GCP console | MISSING (no guidance) | No onboarding guide |
| 3. Create service account | User creates service account + downloads JSON key | MISSING (no guidance) | No onboarding guide |
| 4. Upload service account JSON | Upload key file to platform | MISSING | You require manual server config in `passkit.php` |
| 5. Configure Issuer ID | Set Google Wallet issuer ID | MISSING | Stored in config, no UI |
| 6. Manage credentials in UI | View status, rotate keys | MISSING | No credential management UI |

**Summary:** Your app requires Google credentials in `config/passkit.php` (service account JSON path, issuer ID, app name). PassKit eliminates this entirely -- Google Wallet just works out of the box. **Status: PARTIAL**
